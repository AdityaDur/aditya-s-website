            Hello there! I am <b>Aditya Durvasula</b>, a 13-year-old, <b>grade 8 student</b> currently studying in <b>Edenwood Middle School</b> in Ontario, Canada. I was born in a city called <b>Kolkata, West Bengal</b> (Eastern India), India. 
<br>
</br>
<b>My dream</b> is to become a <b>space scientist, an astrophysicist or an entrepreneur</b> (or maybe even all of them). But as APJ Abdul Kalam once said, <b>"Dream is not that which you see while sleeping; it is something that does not let you sleep".</b> That is why I am preparing for multiple olympiads. Currently I am planning to attend <b>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b> for higher studies, but I am also preparing for the <b>IIT-JEE</b> (for admissions in Indian Institutes of Technology).
<br>
</br>
On a normal weekday, you would find me mostly <b>studying</b> for school, exams, olympiads or some type of work, but when I am free, one could find me <b>biking</b> up and down the street, or scrambling and <b>solving the Rubik's Cube</b> again and again, or <b>playing the guitar</b> for hours, or you could find me <b>coding</b> something on my computer, such as this website. You could also find me reading non-fiction books, or even doing some chemistry experiments.  My favourite subject is <b>Physics</b>. I love it because it is actually practical and useful in real life. I know there is a lot of Maths in Physics as well, but it is not that bad.
